Mental Health professionals from many different fields differ in their opinions on this and related questions. One argument is that people with lower economic and social status (not ethnicity) are possibly more likely to develop mental illness due to the barriers to advancement implicit in those groups' social stature."
How does someone acquire a mental illness?,"Scientists are still studying how people become mentally ill, so we do not know as much as we would like about how a person develops a mental disorder.

Is mental illness a chronic disorder?,"Chronic is defined as, ""lasting for a long period of time or marked by frequent recurrence"" or ""of long duration; continuing."" Many, if not most, mental illnesses could be categorized as chronic in that the individual living with a certain mental illness will never ""get over"" that illness.

Second, many insurance companies refuse to cover illnesses or conditions they believe to be preexisting.

Finally, insurance companies may feel that mental illness diagnoses are not accurate and therefore will refuse to pay for medical treatment associated with that illness."

Some medications, such as Paxil, Prozac, Zoloft, Celexa and Lexapro, can cause sexual side effects, including lowered sex drive, delay in the time it takes for you to have an orgasm, or make you unable to have an orgasm. Not everyone who takes these medications experiences sexual side effects. These types of side effects will usually occur within the first several months of treatment if they are going to happen, and will continue as long as you take the medication."
Will I become addicted to the medication?,"Addiction involves taking more and more of a drug and craving it, despite having negative consequences from taking it. For some people who are addicted, much time is spent making sure that there is always an available supply of the drug. Common addictions are for drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine. Addicted individuals may crave these drugs but sometimes taking them makes them feel paranoid and even hallucinate. 
Most medications for severe brain disorders like schizophrenia or bipolar illness do not pose a risk of addiction. These medications alleviate symptoms and improve your health but there is no craving and the outcome of use is positive. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the risk of addiction with your specific medications."
Why do psychiatric medications cost so much?,"First it is important to understand the difference between receiving a “Brand” or “Trade name” product versus a “generic” form of a medication. A “Brand” name medication has a patent that allows the manufacturer exclusive rights to sell the medication for a certain number of years. “Brand” name drugs cost more because the pharmaceutical company discovering the drug is attempting to recover the hundreds of millions of dollars it took to do the research to make sure the drug is safe and effective. Other costs involved with brand-name medications include manufacturing, distributing, and advertising. When the patent time for a brand-name medication runs out other manufacturers are allowed to make and sell “Generic” versions of the same drug. The active ingredient(s) of ""Generic"" medications are identical to the “Brand” ingredient(s) though the tablet or capsule may look slightly different in color, shape, etc., and generally is less costly. Check with your practitioner or pharmacist to discuss potential alternatives before starting or stopping medications."
"What are the long-term effects of taking medication for mental illness? Will the medicine damage my brain, liver, kidney or other organs?","Medications for mental illness are generally safe and effective when used as prescribed.   As with any medication, however, side effects may occur. Research shows that medications like antipsychotics, lithium and antidepressants can actually protect brain cells from damage caused by brain illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  This improves overall functioning. While this is true, consumers should know that every medication has some risk of long-term adverse effects.  For example, clozapine poses a risk of lowering immune system function, valproate has a risk of causing liver injury and lithium has a risk of decreasing kidney function.  It is a good idea for consumers to be aware of the possible long term adverse effects of each medication prescribed for them. Regular visits to your doctor and blood tests are often necessary to screen for and prevent these adverse effects."
Someone I really care about has mental illness but repeatedly stops taking his medication and his symptoms come back. Sometimes my friend has to be hospitalized. How can I help him?,"One answer is to let the person with mental illness know that he can always count on your love and friendship, but their best chances of improvement will occur when they accept that medication is crucial to their recovery. Sometimes one can help persons struggling with mental illness (especially bipolar disorder or schizophrenia) decide for themselves which is worse – the short periods of time without the medication and side effects, followed by the inevitable resurgence of the illness (often times with worse symptoms than before).....or, the steadier, prolonged times of symptom-free living (or at least more manageable symptoms) while taking the medications, and coping with the side effects?  In a recent study, Hamann and colleagues have shown that higher rates of non-compliance with schizophrenia treatment were associated with re-hospitalizations between 6 and 18 months following a previous hospitalization."
I was recently prescribed an antidepressant. The information sheet from the pharmacy said the medication may increase suicidal thoughts. Is this true?,"It is true that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and young adults up to age 24. However, studies did not show an increased risk beyond age 24. Also, studies show that older adults (ages 65 and older) taking antidepressants actually have a decreased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. The information sheet that came with the medication may be intimidating but if you know what signs to look for, depression can be safely treated."
I have heard that there may be negative effects associated with stopping antidepressants. Is this true?,"Yes, this is true. The effects you may experience if you abruptly stop an antidepressant medication are known as discontinuation or withdrawal symptoms. Up to eighty percent of patients who abruptly stop taking antidepressants develop discontinuation symptoms. These symptoms generally appear within days of stopping an antidepressant and can last up to two weeks. If the antidepressant is restarted, the discontinuation symptoms are quickly eliminated.
In order to avoid withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping these drugs, the dosages are often reduced gradually by your health care provider. Therefore, you should never abruptly stop taking your antidepressant medication. You should always consult your doctor or pharmacist before discontinuing any medication. Finally, be sure to maintain a sufficient amount of antidepressant medications at all times by refilling your prescriptions regularly."
I was told by my doctor that I need to take the medication for the rest of my life. Is it absolutely true that I will have to take the medication for the rest of my life?,"There are a few things to consider when thinking about long-term treatment of mental illness. Similar to the treatment of high blood pressure and diabetes, a person can be on medications for many years, even a lifetime. The reason for this is that they are prescribed by doctors to help relieve symptoms or put disorders in remission but not be a cure in most cases.

Most important, medication treatment needs to be tailored to the person depending on the type of symptoms and response to treatment. Tailored medication treatments are decisions that are made between the person and doctor.

There is some evidence that the longer a person has suffered with a mental illness the longer the person may need to stay on the medications. A person is more likely to need medications for a longer period of time if  1) you have been suffering with a mental illness continuously for 2 years or longer; 2) you have had repeated relapses of the illness; 3) you need combinations of medications to control your symptoms.

The good news is some exciting evidence that the sooner a person is treated for a mental illness the better the response will be."

What Is Racial Trauma?,"Whether it’s subtle everyday discrimination or constant news about violence against people of color over time, the insulting and dehumanising effects of racism can add up to what experts call racial trauma.
The intensity of racial trauma can vary from person to person. In some cases, the symptoms can look a lot like PTSD. It may cause you to revisit distressing events in your head constantly and affect your overall well-being.

How Does Racism Affect Your Physical Health?,"Dealing with racist behaviour regularly, be it subtle or upfront, can definitely shake your mental well-being. It also causes your body to release stress hormones that put you in a heightened, alert state. This can result in physical problems that lead to illness such as
1. Inflammation
2. High cortisol levels
3. High blood pressure
4. Increased heart rate
5. Decreased immune function"

8. Get professional mental health help."
Is Depression Different in Older Adults?,"Feelings of deep sadness or anxiety are not due to aging. They are signs of depression, a serious mood disorder that can affect the way you feel, think, and act.  
Older adults are at an increased risk of depression because 80% have at least one lasting, or chronic, health condition and 50% have two or more illnesses, which can limit your ability to function. Social isolation is a significant cause of depression among older adults. Humans need social connections to thrive."
How Is Psychotic Depression Different Than Other Mental Disorders?,"While people with other mental disorders, like schizophrenia, also experience psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations), people with psychotic depression typically have symptoms that reflect irrational levels of despair and negativism, such as profound feelings of hopelessness, being punished, or having committed a sin. People also may be ashamed or embarrassed and try to hide their psychotic symptoms, or minimize their intensity, which can make diagnosing this condition difficult. In psychotic depression, delusions and hallucinations also are not present unless a depressive syndrome also is present."
What Are the Symptoms of Psychotic Depression?,"1. Anxiety -- fear and nervousness
2. Agitation
3. Paranoia
4. Insomnia -- difficulty falling and staying asleep
5. Physical immobility
6. Intellectual impairment
7. Hallucinations (false perceptions)
8. Delusions (fixed, false beliefs)"

Dysthymia differs from major depression in that dysthymia involves fewer of the above symptoms than occurs in major depression. To be diagnosed with dysthymia, symptoms must persist for at least two years in adults or one year in children or adolescents."
What Are the Symptoms of Depressive Disorder with Seasonal Pattern?,"People who suffer from depressive disorder with seasonal pattern have the symptoms of a major depressive episode. These can include sadness, irritability, loss of interest in their usual activities, withdrawal from social activities, and inability to concentrate. But some symptoms of a winter pattern may be more likely to occur than in a summer pattern.

Symptoms of depression with a winter pattern may include the seasonal occurrence of
1. Fatigue
2. Increased need for sleep
3. Difficulty concentrating
4. Increased desire to be alone

Symptoms of depression with a summer pattern may include the seasonal occurrence of
1. Weight loss
2. Trouble sleeping
3. Decreased appetite"
What Causes Depression?,"There is not just one cause of depression. It is a complex disease that can occur as a result of a multitude of different factors, including biology and emotional and environmental factors. For people biologically vulnerable to depression, it may sometimes start with a significant life event, such as the loss of a loved one or a change in one's life or after being diagnosed with a serious disease. For others, depression may just occur for no apparent ""reason."" In fact, there does not need to be any apparent ""reason"" for the symptoms of depression to occur in people who are vulnerable to the illness."
How Is Depression Diagnosed?,"The diagnosis of depression often begins with a medical and psychiatric history and possibly also a physical exam by a health care provider. Screening and treatment can be managed by a primary care doctor or a mental health professional. Although there are no laboratory tests to specifically diagnose depression, the health care provider may use various tests to look for other medical conditions as the cause of the symptoms. If another medical condition is ruled out, your health care provider may begin treatment with a medicine for depression, or may refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist for evaluation.
Diagnosis is based on the intensity and duration of symptoms -- including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms."
How Is Depression Treated?,"The most common treatment for depression includes the combination of antidepressant drugs, including selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy (talk therapy). Sometimes a combination of medicines is used to treat depression.
Sometimes, certain atypical antipsychotic medicines or other drugs (such as lithium or other mood stabilizers) may be used in combination with antidepressants, when antidepressants alone are not fully effective at treating depression.
Electroconvulsive therapy, also called ECT, an intranasal ketamine spray, or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy, may all be used when highly severe depression is disabling and unresponsive to other forms of therapy."
What Is the Outlook for People With Depression?,"The outlook for depressed people who seek treatment is very promising. By working with a qualified and experienced mental health care professional, you can regain control of your life."
When a Child Needs Mental Health Assessment?,"Just like adults, children can get mental health assessments that involve a series of observations and tests by professionals.

Since it can be hard for very young children to explain what they’re thinking and feeling, the particular screening measures often depend on the child’s age. The doctor will also ask parents, teachers, or other caregivers about what they’ve noticed. A pediatrician can do these evaluations, or you may get referred to another professional who specializes in children’s mental health."
How Does Hypnotherapy Work?,"Hypnotherapy is usually considered an aid to psychotherapy (counselling), rather than a treatment in itself. It helps with psychotherapy because the hypnotic state allows people to enter a deep state of relaxation that can better allow them to explore painful thoughts, feelings, and memories they might have hidden from their conscious minds. In addition, hypnosis enables people to perceive some things differently, such as blocking an awareness of pain.

Hypnotherapy can be used in two ways, as suggestion therapy or for patient analysis.

1. Suggestion therapy The hypnotic state makes the person better able to respond to suggestions. Therefore, hypnotherapy can help some people stop certain behaviours, such as smoking or nail-biting.

2. Analysis This approach was historically used to induce a relaxed and uninhibited state to find suspected unconscious causes of a disorder or symptom, such as a traumatic past event that a person has hidden in their unconscious memory."
What Are the Benefits of Hypnotherapy?,"The hypnotic state allows a person to be more open to discussion and suggestion. It can improve the success of other treatments for many conditions, including
1. Phobias, fears, and anxiety
2. Sleep disorders
3. Depression
4. Stress
5. Post-trauma anxiety
6. Grief and loss

It also might be used to help with pain control and to overcome habits, such as smoking or overeating. It also might be helpful for people whose symptoms are severe or who need crisis management."
What Are the Drawbacks of Hypnotherapy?,"Hypnotherapy might not be appropriate for a person who has psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, or for someone who is using drugs or alcohol. It should be used for pain control only after a doctor has evaluated the person for any physical disorder that might require medical or surgical treatment.
Some therapists use hypnotherapy to recover repressed memories they believe are linked to the person's mental disorder. However, hypnosis also poses a risk of creating false memories -- usually as a result of unintended suggestions by the therapist. For this reason, the use of hypnosis for certain mental disorders remains controversial."
Is Hypnotherapy Dangerous?,"Hypnotherapy is not a dangerous procedure. It is not mind control or brainwashing. A therapist cannot make a person do something embarrassing or that the person doesn't want to do. The greatest risk, as discussed above, is that false memories can be created."
Who Performs Hypnotherapy?,Hypnotherapy is performed by a licensed or certified mental health professional who is specially trained in this technique.
What is the impact of Vitamins on Mental Health?,"Various mental health conditions could have adverse effects on your lifestyle. Among them is depression, a condition that is associated with a lack of some vitamins. It is the most common mental health condition. Statistics show that more than 19 million Americans — nearly 8% of the U.S. population — have experienced depression. It affects people of all ages, races, socioeconomic backgrounds, and ethnicities.
A diet that includes vitamin B complex helps boost mental health. Vitamin B deficiency could negatively influence your memory function, and cause cognitive impairment and dementia. Vitamin B contributes to the complexity of depressive symptoms.
Low levels of folate have been linked to depression. Vitamin supplements such as folic acid (a synthetic form of folate also known as vitamin B9) combined with antidepressants can boost relief in women. Folic acid helps the body make healthy red blood cells."
Does Lack of Sleep Cause Mental Illness?,"Severe sleep deprivation can cause many mental health issues. People who stay awake for days at a time show symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations and disordered thinking. But these situations aren’t typical.
Some people have a combination of mental health and sleep concerns. Many people with mental illnesses such as depression report problems falling asleep or staying asleep. But doctors can't always tell if a lack of sleep led to mental illness or the other way around.
Some experts think that long-term (or chronic) sleep problems raise the risk for certain mental illnesses. At the same time, some mental conditions can cause problems with sleep. Treating sleep problems may ease mental health symptoms. Or you may start sleeping better when you address your mental health."
Mention some Tips for Getting Better Sleep?,"‌Getting more sleep or better quality sleep may improve your mental health. Here are some tips to make falling asleep and staying asleep easier.
1. Turn off screens. The blue light from phones, computers, or TVs can make it harder to fall asleep.‌
2. Avoid caffeine. Coffee, tea, and sodas can affect sleep.
3. Be more active. Getting more physical activity can make you more tired at bedtime.
4. Don't take naps. Instead of napping, power through until bedtime, so you're tired then.
5. Create a calming space. Keep your bedroom clean, uncluttered, dark, and quiet to promote relaxation and sleep.
6. Mediation. Meditation or conscious relaxation can help relax your mind and body to promote sleep.
7. Melatonin. Melatonin is a dietary supplement that increases sleepiness.
8. Keep regular hours. Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time every day.
9. Watch what you eat. Heavy meals or too much alcohol at night can interfere with sleep.
10. Keep a sleep journal. Note your daily activities, meals, mealtimes, and how you slept so you can spot patterns."
What are the Benefits of Journaling?,"Whether you’re dealing with stress from school, burnout from work, an illness, or anxiety, journaling can help in many ways 
1. It can reduce your anxiety. 
2. It helps with brooding.
3. It creates awareness. 
4. It regulates emotions.
5. It encourages opening up.
6. It can speed up physical healing."
What is the Impact of Social Isolation on Your Mental Health?,"Social isolation can affect nearly every aspect of your mental health. Studies show that feelings of isolation can be linked to

1. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts
2. Less restful sleep
‌3. Decreased ability to regulate eating
‌4. More stress, especially in the morning
‌5. Greater difficulty paying attention and doing complex tasks

People of all ages are vulnerable to the effects of social isolation. If you experience loneliness as a pre-teen or teenager, for example, you’re more likely to struggle with depression in adulthood.
Older adults are vulnerable emotionally and cognitively. Social isolation can cause up to a 40% increase in dementia risk."
How to cope up with social isolcation?,"No matter how old you are, it’s important to recognize when you struggle with social isolation. Noticing is the first step to developing healthy coping mechanisms. To cope with social isolation, try to

1. Acknowledge your feelings. Sometimes it seems easier to ignore your feelings when you’re struggling, especially when it feels like you have no one to talk to. Take some time to acknowledge that things are hard. If you need to, reach out to a therapist.

2. Get outside. Being outdoors is beneficial to your mental and physical health. The natural light can help to boost your mood and the vitamin D in sunlight can ease symptoms of depression.

3. Reconnect with your interests. If you find you have more time to yourself, think about what solo hobbies you used to enjoy or always wanted to take up. Pursuing a new hobby can redirect your mind and give you something positive to think about.

4. Check in with people you know. When you’ve been isolated, it’s easy to feel that people are doing fine without you. It’s a common self-fulfilling prophecy brought on by loneliness, and it’s usually not true — unless it causes you to withdraw from others and treat them as though you know they don’t care."
How Sports Help Your Mental Health?,"We all know that sports are great for your physical health. But sports also have many psychological benefits.

1. Help moderate stress. About 75% to 90% of doctor visits are for stress-related illnesses. Sports help you manage stress. Exercise causes your body to release endorphins, the chemicals in your brain that relieve pain and stress. It also reduces the levels of stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline.

2. Improve your mood. Playing a sport such as golf or skiing forces you to put aside your worries and concentrate on the task at hand. This helps you clear your mind and calm down. It also helps you sleep better. 

3. Boost mental health with team sports. Taking part in sports in a group has a greater impact on mental health than individual sports.

4. Help fight addiction. A study of Norwegian teenagers found that those who played in team sports were less likely to smoke cigarettes and use cannabis as adults. 

5. Help with depression. Sports help treat depression. Exercise was found to be as effective as standard antidepressant treatment in one study, with modest amounts of exercise helping to improve depression.

6. Improve serious mental disorders. Exercise can help if you have a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia. It improves some symptoms of schizophrenia, including loss of motivation and thinking difficulties, but is less effective with other symptoms like hallucinations."
Are there any Negative Effects of Sports on Mental Health?,"While sports provide many benefits, they can have negative effects on the mental health of more advanced athletes, especially elite athletes. Elite athletes play at varsity, regional, national, or professional levels. 
1. Stress. While sports relieve stress, sometimes they create it. Parents or coaches may push children too hard. Older athletes may place pressure on themselves to perform well. This leads to burnout, which is when an athlete’s performance worsens despite intense training.
2. Depression. Many high-profile athletes struggle with mental health issues. Researchers say certain factors may increase the risk of depression among athletes. These include injury, retirement from the sport, and performance expectations. It’s also possible that there may be underreporting of depression among athletes."
What are those things that Affect Mental Health at Work?,"Some things that may affect your mental health in the workplace include

1. Excessive workload. A heavy workload could cause employee burnout. Burnout, or exhaustion, is a common cause of mental health problems in the workplace. Burnt out employees cannot work efficiently. This can mean losses or lessened profits for the employer. Many companies dedicate a budget to help their employees take care of their mental health.
2. Poor pay. Constant pressure to make more money eventually affects your mental health. When employees are underpaid and overworked, mental conditions like anxiety and depression are more likely to happen.
3. Stigma. Mental health is still a delicate topic for many. Not many people are comfortable speaking up about their personal mental struggles with co-workers.."
How to prevent Mental Health Issues in the Workplace?,"When you have a mental health issue related to work, experts recommend asking for help from a professional and other people close to you. Most organizations have an employee assistance program.
If you feel you need more help than what’s available through your employer, talk to your doctor. Mental health can be treated through various forms of therapy. Your doctor may prescribe medications or recommend other alternatives like psychotherapy."
How to Deal with Homesickness?,"1. Know that it’s normal. Being in a new place and missing your home, family, friends, and pets, is completely normal. It means that you have a healthy attachment to your loved ones. It will take a while to adjust to your new surroundings. 

2. Attend events or take classes. Some companies or universities organise events for international employees or students, and this may encourage you to learn more about your new place of residence, and meet new people.

3. Be active. Taking part in sports and physical activities can help you take your mind off your homesickness and boost your mood. Team sports can also help you make new social connections and find social support. 

4. Make friends with locals. It may help you adjust more easily to your new place if you get to know some locals, especially if you’re from somewhere that’s very different.

5. Gratitude journal. Journaling can help with your feelings of homesickness. Every night, try writing down three things you’re grateful for and three things you’re looking forward to the next day."
How to Use Yoga to Improve Your Mental Health?,"The best way to learn yoga is with a qualified teacher, either in a private session or in a group. A yoga teacher can correct your poses and show you how to modify them if necessary. You can use blocks, straps, and other items to make some poses easier. You can even do yoga in a chair instead of on the floor. 

It's also possible to learn yoga online or from a book or DVD. But the best way to avoid injury is to take an in-person yoga class. Once you have the basics down, you can use books and videos to help you practice. You will benefit more from yoga if you do it at home between classes, and online classes can keep your home practice interesting. If you are comfortable doing yoga at home, you can practice when you experience extra stress, sleeplessness, or other challenges."
Who Treats Mental Illness?,"Many health care professionals do this, including

1. Primary care doctor These doctors are either MDs or DOs who have general knowledge in treating a wide variety of common conditions. They are sometimes called general practitioners.
2. Physician assistant (PA) These caregivers are not doctors, but they are trained to identify symptoms of mental illness and to treat mental disorders under a doctor’s supervision.
3. Nurse practitioner These registered nurses (RNs) have extra training, including some background in treating psychiatric problems.
4. Psychiatrist These are medical doctors (MDs) who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses. Psychiatrists can prescribe drugs as part of their treatment plan. They are also trained in psychotherapy, a form of counseling or “talk therapy.”
5. Psychologist These experts aren’t MDs, but they have advanced degrees in psychology (PhD or PsyD). They are trained in counseling, psychotherapy, and psychological testing. They cannot prescribe drugs to treat mental illnesses except in certain states.
6. Social worker These specialists can provide counseling services and social service needs. They are trained to recognize mental illness and can do psychotherapy.
7. Psychiatric nurse specialist These are registered nurses (RNs) who specialize in treating mental or psychiatric illnesses."
What are the benefits of listening to Music?,"Whether you’re on edge or need a boost, even just one song can bring you back to a more even and healthy place. When it comes to your mental health, music can‌‌
1. Help you rest better. A study involving students found that listening to relaxing classical music at bedtime improved sleep quality. This activity was also associated with decreased signs of depression. ‌

2. Lift your mood. Research shows that listening to happier music can make you feel happier, especially if you try to lift your mood while listening. There’s also evidence that formal music therapy can help with depression when used alongside other therapies.

3. Reduce stress. If you’re feeling anxious or stressed, calming music can help to settle your mind. Several studies have shown that when people undergoing surgery hear calming music, they have lower blood pressure and need less pain medication than those who don’t listen to soothing music."
What is the Impact of Spirituality on Mental Health?,"Spirituality influences many decisions that people make. It encourages people to have better relationships with themselves, others, and the unknown. Spirituality can help you deal with stress by giving you a sense of peace, purpose, and forgiveness. It often becomes more important in times of emotional stress or illness.
Many people with a mental illness get a sense of hope by talking with a religious or spiritual leader. Some mental illnesses can be seen as times when people question their value or purpose in a way that leaves them feeling pessimistic. It can be extremely helpful to include spirituality in the treatment of mental health difficulties. ‌"
What Are the Dangers of Suppressed Anger?,"Suppressed, unexpressed anger can be an underlying cause of anxiety and depression. Anger that is not appropriately expressed can disrupt relationships, affect thinking and behavior patterns, and create a variety of physical problems. Chronic (long-term) anger has been linked to health issues such as high blood pressure, heart problems, headaches, skin disorders, and digestive problems. In addition, poorly managed anger can be linked to problems such as alcohol and substance abuse, crime, emotional and physical abuse, and other violent behavior."
What Steps Can I Take to Help Manage My Anger?,"1. When you start feeling angry, try deep breathing, positive self-talk, or stopping your angry thoughts.
2. Avoid alcohol or illicit drugs that can make you more likely to act on angry feelings impulsively.
3. Although expressing anger is better than keeping it in, anger should be expressed in an appropriate way.
4. Seek out the support of others. Talk through your feelings and try to work on changing your behaviors.
5. Try to gain a different perspective by putting yourself in another's place.
6. Learn how to laugh at yourself and see humor in situations.
7. Practice good listening skills. Listening can help improve communication and can facilitate trusting feelings between people. This trust can help you deal with potentially hostile emotions."
Do I Have Clinical Depression?,"Are you wondering if you have clinical depression? This quiz may help you tell if you're at risk. Don't hesitate to ask for help; depression can be treated.

1. Have you been in a depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day for at least two weeks?
2. Have you lost interest or pleasure in most daily activities, nearly every day for at least two weeks?
3. Have you experienced a significant weight change (at least five pounds) either loss or gain recently?
4. Has your appetite changed (increased or decreased) for an extended period?
5. Have you suffered from insomnia or hypersomnia (oversleeping), nearly every day for at least two weeks?
6. Have you felt tired or experienced a loss of energy during the day, nearly every day for at least two weeks?
7. Have you had guilty feelings or feelings of worthlessness nearly every day for at least two weeks?
8. Have you had difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions nearly every day?
9. Have you had any thoughts of death or any thoughts of suicide without any specific plan?

a) Did you mark yes for either question 1 or 2?
b) Did you mark yes four or more times in questions 3-9?

If you responded yes to both (a) and (b), you may be suffering from an episode of major depression.

If your symptoms are disabling and severe over a few weeks -- and especially if you are having suicidal thoughts -- you should seek professional treatment."
"If I’m feeling suicidal, what should I do?","“Depressive episodes,” as they’re called, can raise the chances of suicidal thoughts. They’re an emergency, so tell your doctor immediately or call 988 or 911 if this happens to you."
Why is behavioral health important?,"Behavioral health is important because it looks at a larger picture that includes mental health. It considers how a single behavior can be both a cause and effect, with consequences across multiple health domains."
What are the similarities between Mental and behavioral health?,"Mental health is a component of behavioral health. Mental health is often the “why” behind certain behaviors, or the lack thereof.
A 2018 study, for example, found that positive mental health features like high self-esteem predicted more beneficial behavioral outcomes among low-income inner-city youth.
But behavioral health can also overlap with mental health.
For example, depriving yourself of sleep is a behavior that has both physical and psychological consequences. Research has shown that inadequate sleep significantly increases the odds of experiencing regular mental distress.
From a behavioral perspective, however, sleep deprivation has a larger wellness effect. It has also been associated with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease."
How to change my eating habits for better mental health?,"As research shows us more about how the foods we eat can affect our bodies, we gain more tools in our nutritional toolbox that we can use to help improve our overall health and mental well-being on a daily basis.
Whole foods provide many nutrients that ultra-processed foods lack, which in turn supports all of our body’s functions in order to promote health and wellness. Start simple by adding a piece of fruit as a snack or by adding fresh or frozen vegetables into your meals.
Take steps to decrease your intake of ultra-processed foods over time and limit them to only occasional use.  Examples of ultra-processed foods would be items such as soft drinks, hot dogs, packaged cookies, or sweetened breakfast cereals"
What About Depression Later In Life?,"For older adults who experience depression for the first time later in life, other factors, such as changes in the brain or body, may be at play. For example, older adults may suffer from restricted blood flow, a condition called ischemia. Over time, blood vessels become less flexible. They may harden and prevent blood from flowing normally to the body’s organs, including the brain. If this occurs, an older adult with no family or personal history of depression may develop what some doctors call “vascular depression.” Those with vascular depression also may be at risk for a coexisting cardiovascular illness, such as heart disease or a stroke."
What Efforts Are Underway To Improve Treatment Of Depression?,"Researchers are looking for ways to better understand, diagnose and treat depression among all groups of people. Studying strategies to personalize care for depression, such as identifying characteristics of the person that predict which treatments are more likely to work, is an important goal."
How Can Treatment-Resistant Depression Be Treated?,Treatment of resistant depression has most commonly been treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT has been modified to avoid the pain previously associated with it and is the most effective and quick-acting treatment for resistant depression. The downside is that it works by inducing brain seizures and can impair memory. Its therapeutic benefits can also fade over time. New methods of brain stimulation also offer the possibility of relief. These technologies exploit the fact that the brain is an electrical organ it responds to electrical and magnetic stimulation to modulate brain circuits and change brain activity.
What are the risks of untreated depression?,"Untreated depression can increase risk of depressive episodes becoming more frequent, prolonged and/or severe over time and increase risk of suicide. It can significantly interfere with one’s functioning at work, school, and/or in interpersonal relationships. Depression can also increase risk of alcohol and/or substance use disorders. Additionally, depression can worsen the course and outcome of chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and others."
What are other psychiatric conditions that can co-exist with depression?,"Anxiety disorders and substance use disorders are some of the psychiatric conditions commonly found co-existing with major depressive disorder. Other psychiatric conditions too, such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), eating disorders, can co-occur with depression."
What is self-management?,"Self-management courses can help you better understand your mental health condition and consider what helps you stay well. They can also help you plan for times when you’re unwell or in a crisis. They’re often designed and/or delivered by people with lived experience of mental ill-health.
Courses usually include
1. information about your condition and ways to treat it
2. ways to recognise early warning signs of a relapse
3. coping skills to deal with your symptoms

They can also help you feel more assertive when asking mental health services for the support you need.
Courses are free and provided by the NHS as well as other groups and organisations. Some are in-person, while others are online - either through live video calls or online videos you can work through at your own pace.
As well as courses, self-management can include webinars, health and wellbeing plans you can complete yourself, or wellness recovery action plans (WRAPS)."
Is self-management right for me?,"Courses can cover challenging topics, so it might not be right for you if you’re unwell or have recently been hospitalised for your mental health condition. You also have to be able to manage being in a group, often for several hours at a time."
How do self-management courses work?,"Self-management courses are based on the principle that you know what works best for you – better than anyone else. During a course, you'll typically learn to

1. recognise what triggers a relapse in your mental health condition
2. spot the early warning signs of a relapse 
3. identify what, if anything, can prevent a relapse
4. figure out which coping strategies work best for you
5. tap into other sources of support like local peer support groups
6. build coping strategies into your life
7. make an action plan 
7. draw up an advance decision and/or advance statement setting out how you'd like to be treated if you ever lack the mental capacity to make decisions about treatment in the future"
How can I find a self-management course?,"Ask your GP or other health worker involved in your care about self-management courses on the NHS, or search online to find out what’s available in your area. You may need a referral or be able to refer yourself.

Other organisations also run self-management courses, such as
1. Self Management UK runs free courses that look at the challenges that can come with a mental health condition and ways to deal with them.
2. Bipolar UK has a series of free self-management webinars that can help you understand bipolar disorder, learn different approaches to managing it, identify your triggers, and more.
3. If you live in Scotland, Bipolar Scotland runs a self-management course that teaches you how to recognise your early warning signs and take action to prevent your mood from escalating to severe depression or mania."
Does generalized anxiety disorder run in families?,"Having a family member with GAD appears to heighten one’s risk slightly for developing it. The family influence appears to be related to both genetic and environmental sources.
There may be, for instance, a genetic predisposition for a person to be at greater risk for having generalized anxiety disorder, but it’s not something activated in everyone who has the predisposition."
What is the best way to treat children with anxiety disorders?,"Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication are effective in treating children with anxiety disorders. Recent research found that a combination of CBT and an antidepressant worked better for children ages 7-17 than either treatment alone.
Because one child may respond better, or sooner, to a particular treatment than another child with the same diagnosis, it’s important to discuss with your doctor or therapist how to decide which treatment works best for your child and family lifestyle."

What Is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder?,"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. After traumatic events, such as death, an earthquake, war, car accidents, floods or fires, it is not uncommon for people to experience feelings of heightened fear, worry, sadness or anger. If the emotions persist, however, or become severe, or the person gets triggered into reliving the event in their daily life, this can affect the person’s ability to function and may be a sign of PTSD."
Are There Coping Factors To Help Deal Effectively With Stress?,"In their 20 years of treating and studying trauma survivors, Drs. Dennis Charney and Steven Southwick have identified ten common practices in people who have shown resilience in the face of extreme stress
1. Maintaining an optimistic but realistic outlook
2. Facing fear (ability to confront one’s fears)
3. Reliance upon own inner, moral compass
4. Turning to religious or spiritual practices
5. Seeking and accepting social support
6. Imitation of sturdy role models
7. Staying physically fit
8. Staying mentally sharp
9. Cognitive and emotional flexibility (finding a way to accept that which cannot be changed)
10. Looking for meaning and opportunity in the midst of adversity"
How to treat OCD?,"There’s no cure for OCD. But you may be able to manage how your symptoms affect your life through medicine, therapy, or a combination of treatments.

Treatments include
1. Psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help change your thinking patterns. In a form called exposure and response prevention, your doctor will put you in a situation designed to create anxiety or set off compulsions. You’ll learn to lessen and then stop your OCD thoughts or actions.

2. Relaxation. Simple things like meditation, yoga, and massage can help with stressful OCD symptoms.

3 .Medication. Psychiatric drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors help many people control obsessions and compulsions. They might take 2 to 4 months to start working. Common ones include citalopram (Celexa), clomipramine (Anafranil), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine, paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). If you still have symptoms, your doctor might give you antipsychotic drugs like aripiprazole (Abilify) or risperidone (Risperdal).

4. Neuromodulation. In rare cases, when therapy and medication aren’t making enough of a difference, your doctor might talk to you about devices that change the electrical activity in a certain area of your brain. One kind, transcranial magnetic stimulation, is FDA-approved for OCD treatment. It uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells. A more complicated procedure, deep brain stimulation, uses electrodes that are implanted in your head."
What is the evidence on vaping?,"Though less harmful than smoking cigarettes, vaping still carries potential harms. There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer). Some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine. E-cigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands. Other chemicals, flavourings, and heavy metals present in vaping liquids, have not as yet been well studied. Long-term health risks from vaping are thus undetermined. More research is needed in these areas.

Marketing strategies for vaping products, often on social media, are designed to appeal to young people. The range of flavours available, especially those that are fruity and sweet, and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth. Young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and 'smoke' in a less harmful way."
When is substance use a problem? Where can I go for help?,"Each person has a different relationship with substances like alcohol and other drugs, and people use substances for different reasons. What’s beneficial for some may cause problems for others, or for the same person in different situations.
If you or someone you care about needs more help, contact the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service to find support in your area. To get help anywhere in BC, call 1-800-663-1441. In Greater Vancouver, call 604-660-9382."
How can I find help for an alcohol or drug use problem?,"Seeking to make changes in the way you use substances like alcohol or other drugs? This can be an important step!

One way to get help is to talk to a doctor you trust and feel comfortable confiding in. If you aren’t comfortable talking in person, you can also get advice from a registered nurse (along with advice on programs or services in your area) by calling HealthLink BC at 8-1-1. Since some drugs are illegal, many people worry about what might happen if they talk about drug use. It’s important to know that in most cases, doctors have to protect your privacy—it’s the law.
In BC, the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service can help you find information on treatment options, support groups and other resources throughout the province. It’s free, confidential, and available 24/7. Call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441 or 604-660-9382 in the Lower Mainland."
How do I know if I’m drinking too much?,"Sorting out if you are drinking too much can be complicated. You are unique and your relationship with alcohol is unique. No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences that you do. So even though you and your friend may choose to drink, how and why you use alcohol may be different.

Whenever you decide to drink alcohol, it is helpful to know what steps you can take to ensure that your drinking behaviour is the most rewarding and least harmful possible. The following are some useful guidelines to consider.
1. Managing how much you drink on a given occasion helps decrease risky behaviours.
2. Drink slowly and alternate between non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages.
3. Drinking in moderation helps to reduce harms to ourselves and others over time.
4. Keep less alcohol at home and set limits on how much you are going to drink each week, avoiding drinking on some days.
5. If going to a bar, stay with a group and choose an establishment that is well lit and near safe transportation options."
How do I know if I have an unhealthy relationship with food?,"To understand what an unhealthy relationship with food looks like, it can be helpful to first have an idea of what a healthy one looks like. A healthy relationship with food can take some work and conscious effort, but it is well worth the work because it allows us to have a flexible, healthy, and balanced relationship with our eating habits and food in general.

What are some signs of a healthy relationship with food
1. Moving away from dieting and strict rules around food and eating
2. Being aware of what your body needs and its natural hunger cues
3. Focusing on nutrition over calories"
Do past or current difficulties in life mean I’ll develop a mental health condition?,"No. Many people experience major stress in life, including poverty, unemployment, trauma, abuse, family difficulties, or chronic health problems. Experiencing these stressful situations does not mean you will definitely develop a mental health condition. But if you do experience serious, stressful situations and develop a mental health condition, know that it is not your fault. You can get help and treatment for mental health conditions.

Learning ways to manage stress and reaching out for help when you need it can help you protect your mental health."
"How does smoking, drinking alcohol, or misusing drugs affect mental health?","The chemicals in tobacco and alcohol can change the chemicals in your brain, making you more likely to feel depressed or anxious. People with mental health conditions are also more likely to smoke and drink alcohol.

Using illegal drugs, or misusing prescription drugs, is also linked to mental health conditions. Researchers are not sure whether drugs can cause mental health conditions, whether mental health conditions cause addiction, or whether both are linked to another health problem. People who have experienced trauma, whether physical or emotional (or both), are more likely to misuse drugs and alcohol."
How does aging affect my mental health?,"As you age, your body and brain change. These changes can affect your physical and mental health. Older women may face more stressful living or financial situations than men do, because women live longer on average. They may also have spent more time staying home to raise children or care for loved ones instead of working outside of the home.

In the years leading up to menopause (perimenopause), women may experience shifts in mood because of hormone changes. They may also experience hot flashes, problems sleeping, and other symptoms that can make it harder to deal with stress or other life changes."
How does physical activity affect my mental health?,"Physical activity can help your mental health in several ways

1. Aerobic exercise can boost your mood. Your body makes certain chemicals, called endorphins, during and after your workout. Endorphins relieve stress and make you feel calmer.

2. Getting physical activity during the day can make it easier to sleep at night. Creating a routine can help you stay motivated and build a habit of getting regular physical activity.

3. Physical activity may help with depression and anxiety symptoms. Studies show that regular aerobic exercise boosts your mood and lowers anxiety and depression.

4. Physical activity may help slow or stop weight gain, which is a common side effect of some medicines used to treat mental health conditions."
How do traumatic or negative childhood events affect mental health?,"Two out of every 3 women have experienced at least one serious traumatic or negative event during childhood, increasing their risk of adult health problems, including mental health conditions.

1. Traumatic events can include physical or sexual abuse, neglect, bullying, neighbourhood violence, natural disasters, terrorism, and war.

2. Negative events during childhood can include abuse (physical, emotional, verbal, or sexual), neglect, or a problem with an adult in the home, such as seeing domestic violence or having a caregiver go to prison. 

The more negative childhood events you have experienced, the higher your risk of a serious health problem as an adult.
Women are more likely than men to experience certain types of trauma, such as sexual abuse or assault, and are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition."
Why is women’s mental health important?,"Mental disorders can affect women and men differently. Some disorders are more common in women, such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. There are also certain disorders that are unique to women. For example, some women experience symptoms of depression at times of hormone change, such as during or after pregnancy (perinatal depression), around the time of their period (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), and during menopause (perimenopause-related depression)."
